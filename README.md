Ascia is a program for assisting in data input and grading for the locomotor rating scale published by D. MICHELE BASSO,
MICHAEL S. BEATTIE, and JACQUELINE C. BRESNAHAN in the article "A Sensitive and Reliable Locomotor Rating Scale for
Open Field Testing in Rats" published in Journal Of Neurotrauma To use the program, select an option in the file menu to
connect to an Excel file to save
the records produced by the program.
You can connect to an existing file by selecting load file, or you can allow the program to create a new Excel file by
selecting new file. The interface represents a single
record for rating a single animal.
After filling in the relevant information, you can optionally let the program automatically grade the record by pressing
the grade button. The result can be
manually overridden if desired by changing the values in the grade fields. Finally, pressing submit will save the record
as a row in the Excel table and reset the interface for inputing a new record.
